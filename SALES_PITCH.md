# 🦊 Kitsune Finance - The Private Agentic Terminal
**Status:** Alpha v5.0 (Production Ready Core) | **Asking Price:** $30,000 (Tech Transfer)

## ⚡ Executive Summary
Kitsune Finance is a **privacy-first, autonomous due-diligence terminal** designed for institutional crypto analysis. Unlike standard chatbots, Kitsune uses a proprietary **headless browser engine** to navigate live web pages, verify audited contracts on-chain, and visualize data without revealing intent to third-party APIs.

Built on **local LLMs (Ollama)**, it offers hedge-fund grade analytics with zero data leakage.

## 💎 Key Assets Included
1.  **The Agentic Core (Python/LangChain Custom)**: 
    - A robust "Thought-Action-Observation" loop fine-tuned for financial reasoning.
    - **Memory Persistence**: Context-aware short-term memory that survives session reloads.
2.  **Visual Interaction Engine**: 
    - Proprietary `KitsuneBrowserTool` running on Playwright.
    - **Live Sandbox UI**: A cinematic 16:9 interface that shows the agent's "eyes" (screenshots) in real-time as it works, building supreme user trust.
3.  **Institutional Dashboard**:
    - Streamlit-based frontend with integrated Monte Carlo simulations, Correlation Matrix, and DCA Calculators.
    - Pre-configured for World Chain, Ethereum, and Macro assets.

## 🛡️ Technical Moat (Why buy vs build?)
- **Zero-Day Privacy**: Architecture designed to run 100% offline/local. No OpenAI API keys required.
- **Antibot-Proof Navigation**: Custom browser headers and behavior patterns to bypass "Are you a robot" checks on financial sites.
- **Hybrid Intelligence**: Combines Quantitative Analysis (Python Pandas/NumPy) with Qualitative Reasoning (LLM).

## 🎯 Ideal Acquirer Profile
1.  **Crypto VC / Hedge Funds**: To automate L1/L2 due diligence scounting.
2.  **Fintech API Providers**: To add an "Agent Layer" on top of their data feeds.
3.  **Privacy-First AI Startups**: Looking for a solid, audited agentic framework to pivot into Finance.
